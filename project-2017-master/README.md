## Project Specifications
For this project we were asked to create a countdown numbers game which consists on six random numbers and a target number. The target number is a randomly generated three digit integer between 101 and 999 inclusive. The six random numbers are selected from the following list of numbers: <br> [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9,10,10,25,50,75,100] <br> Four basic operations; add, subtract, multiply and divide must be used along with 6 random numbers from the list above to calculate the target number if possible. Not all the number have to be used and if the same number appears twice in the list then that number can be used twice. 

### Racket
Racket is a general-purpose programming language as well as the worldâ€™s first ecosystem for developing and deploying new languages.
